# JSAgar
A Javascript project meant to emulate Agario using the p5.js library. 

This project is in progress and is meant as a way for me to hone my javascript skills. 

Please note that p5.js needs to be referenced in order for the code to work.

p5.js can be downloaded here: https://p5js.org/download/

Or you can also run the code in the online editor: https://editor.p5js.org/

Going to the editor and pasting the main javascript file's contents directly in will work. Try it, its fun!
